    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and typically milk, then pan fried. Alternative names and variants include "eggy bread",[1] "Bombay toast", "gypsy toast",[2] and "poor knights" (of Windsor).[3]

        When French toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla or cinnamon are also commonly added before pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such as ketchup or mayonnaise.[4][5][6][7]

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bread</li>
        <li>1 egg (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1-2 cups milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the bread slices diagonally in half.</li>
        <li>In a deep bowl, pour in milk</li>
        <li>Crack the egg into the milk and beat the mixture until the egg had been fully incorporated. Skip this step if you are not using eggs.</li>
        <li>If you use sugar, you may already dissolve it into the liquid ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add oil and butter into the frying panand heat it until very hot. Oil and butter will prevent the butter from burning too soon and enhance the flavor.</li>
        <li>Very carefully, place 4 slices of bread into the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cinnamon and serve.</li>
    </ol>
